If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

-I think it would be a combination between orange and a little of blue
there's alot of really energetic music here, but also there's some
melancholy music too.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be
very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating
this aura would you propose?

-It's really hard to differentiate a calm music from a melancholy, for example
in the aura might look like a really melancholy person but in the end the person
maybe just really like to listen calm music.
I think a better way to calculating is to put some musical genre average in
this equation.
