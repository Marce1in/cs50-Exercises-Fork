            </h1>
            <p>
              Hey there! I'm Marcelo, an 18-year-old Brazilian developer who's simply looking for happiness.
              Coding is my passion (except for CSS, I'm not a big fan of that). Currently, I'm enrolled in
              two courses: CS50 and a SENAC course (a Brazilian university). Next year, I plan to attend college,
              although I haven't decided on the exact course just yet. However, I'm certain it will be related to
              computers. I hope you enjoyed this website; it was quite a remarkable challenge for me and taught
              me a lot about front-end development. It also made me realize that CSS isn't my cup of tea.

              What are my experiences in coding?
            </h1>
            <p>
              The bulk of my coding experiences stem from my CS50 course. It has been an incredible journey where
              I've delved into various programming languages such as C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and even
              dabbled in mySQLITE. Along the way, I've gained valuable insights into how computers function and operate.
              In addition to CS50, I'm also enrolled in a SENAC course that primarily focuses on Python. While it may seem
              like a smaller course in comparison, it shouldn't be underestimated. It has taught me the importance of
              teamwork and provided me with a unique perspective on how others perceive coding. This knowledge has proven
              to be quite invaluable. As for professional experience, I'm still in the early stages of building my portfolio.
              However, I remain hopeful that one day I'll have the opportunity to apply my skills and gain practical work experience.

              What are my dreams?
            </h1>
            <p>
              At the moment, I don't have a laundry list of grand, long-term dreams. Life seems to be zooming by
              faster than I anticipated. However, I do have a simple aspiration: to break free from being a slave
              to money throughout my entire life. Money shouldn't dictate every aspect of my existence. In the short
              term, my dreams revolve around exploring various programming areas and discovering the one that truly
              captures my heart. I also yearn to kick my habit of procrastinating on my projects, reignite my exercise
              routine, and engage in more meaningful conversations with people. Ultimately, my goal is to find happiness.
              Is that really too much to ask for?

            <p>
              My hobbies are diverse and exciting! I'm an avid gamer, especially drawn to indie titles. I also enjoy tinkering
              with and fixing computers, embracing my inner tech nerd. Reading, from complex books to manga, keeps me entertained.
              Staying active through exercise, cooking, and cleaning brings me satisfaction. Japanese music has a special place in
              my heart. Lastly, I spend time philosophizing about life, exploring its deeper aspects.

            </h1>
            <p>
              Today, my main focus is completing the courses I'm currently enrolled in and honing my coding skills further.
              Perhaps I'll even make progress towards securing a job, although it's unlikely given the stagnant market this year.
              Looking ahead to the long term, I aspire to purchase my own house and adopt a cat (finding a girlfriend might be a bit more challenging).
              Additionally, I aim to prioritize my mental health and boost my self-esteem through regular exercise.
